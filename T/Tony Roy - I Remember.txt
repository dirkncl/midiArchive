I Remember
(Tony Roy - 1997)

I woke up at six in the morning
To the ring of a bell
In my third class Hotel
Who was phoning I was still yawning
As I started to say
Don't disturb me today

I heard a lady's voice
Softly say Hello
Do you remember Reno last year?
Like a flash in my brain
It was clear to me
It was Mary my girl she was here

I remember all the days
We spent dreaming
I remember all the days
We shared our love
I remember all the nights
And all your kisses
I can't believe you come to me
I'm still in love

I recall we made love till the sunrise
Hearing love melodies
From the birds on the trees
There was magic shining from your eyes
Oh oh I wanted to stay
Business called me away

It was so hard to go
leaving you behind
As I held you in my arms once more.
And I will never forget 'Cause at last I found
What I've always been searching for

I remember all the days
We spent dreaming
I remember all the days
We shared our love
I remember all the nights
And all your kisses
I can't believe you come to me
I'm still in love

I remember all the days
We spent dreaming
I remember all the days
We shared our love
I remember all the nights
And all your kisses
I can't believe you come to me
I'm still in love

I can't believe you come to me
I'm still in love...
