Silver Bird
(Tina Rainford - 1976)

Long before I came to New York City
I have left my man in San Antone
Heaven knows, that life can be a pity
Without this man of mine
The sun ain’t gonna shine
 
  Silver bird, silver bird, silver bird, keep on flying
  Silver bird, silver bird, silver bird, my heart’s sighing
  Silver bird, silver bird, silver bird, oh, he’s waiting
  He’ll wait for me till I come back home
  Long time he was alone
 
Deep inside I feel the good vibration
I can smell the green, green grass of home
I can’t wait no more, I’ve lost my patience
Oh heaven, can’t you see
What’s going on with me
 
  Silver bird, silver bird, silver bird, keep on flying
  Silver bird, silver bird, silver bird, my heart’s sighing
  Silver bird, silver bird, silver bird, oh, he’s waiting
  He’ll wait for me till I come back home
  Long time he was alone
  
Silver bird, silver bird, silver bird, keep on flying
Silver bird, silver bird, silver bird, my heart’s sighing...
